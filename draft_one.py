    Logic for function:
    1. Create a loop that goes through each item in the password list
     You can consult the reading on lists in Week 5 for ways to loop through a list

    2. Check if the name is found.  To index a list of lists you use 2 square backet sets
      So passwords[0][1] would mean for the first item in the list get it's 2nd item (remember, lists start at 0)
      So this would be 'XqffoZeo' in the password list given what is predefined at the top of the page.
      If you created a loop using the syntax described in step 1, then i is your 'iterator' in the list so you
      will want to use i in your first set of brackets.

    3. If the name is found then decrypt it.  Decrypting is that exact reverse operation from encrypting.  Take a look at the
    caesar cypher lecture as a reference.  You do not need to write your own decryption function, you can reuse passwordEncrypt

     Write the above one step at a time.  By this I mean, write step 1...  but in your loop print out every item in the list
     for testing purposes.  Then write step 2, and print out the password but not decrypted.  Then write step 3.  This way
     you can test easily along the way.
